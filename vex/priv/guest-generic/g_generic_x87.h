/* This file contains functions for doing some x87-specific
   operations.  Both the amd64 and x86 front ends (guests) indirectly
   call these functions via guest helper calls.  By putting them here,
   code duplication is avoided.  Some of these functions are tricky
   and hard to verify, so there is much to be said for only having one
