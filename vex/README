This directory contains the Vex dynamic translation library that
underlies Valgrind.  With the exception of the following five files,
all files are copyright OpenWorks LLP, and are licensed under the GNU
GPL version 2 (see COPYING).

  test/test-i386.c           (Fabrice Bellard, GNU GPL)
  test/test-amd64.c          (Fabrice Bellard, GNU GPL)
  switchback/linker.c        (University of Glasgow, BSD-style license)
  switchback/test_emfloat.c  (BYTE magazine, public domain?)
  switchback/test_ppc_jm1.c  (Jocelyn Mayer, GNU GPL)

Changes: if you wish to contribute a change which is a significant one
in terms of the amount of code changes, please be aware that OpenWorks
LLP wishes to retain copyright of the Vex library.  Therefore you will
have to sign over copyright ownership of your code to OpenWorks LLP
before we can include your changes in the main source tree.

Finally, before you start modifying anything for real, you should
probably join the valgrind-developers mailing list and send it mail
describing what you want to do and how you want to do it so you don't
waste time working on something we can't integrate. This also allows
us to keep track of what's being worked on so efforts aren't
duplicated.
