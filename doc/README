The file dyncomp-notes.docx is a Word document that describes
some of the basic data structures and algorithms used in
DynComp to calculate comparability sets.

The docment contains a single diagram that was generated
in PowerPoint.  The work flow is as follows:

1) Use PowerPoint to modify the diagram on the single
   slide in the file dyncomp-diagram.pptx.
2) Save the slide but also do a 'Save As' selecting
   the Enhanced Windows Metafile format.  This generates
   dyncomp-diagram.emf.
3) Open dyncomp-notes.docx with Word.  Make any required
   changes to the document.
4) Locate the current diagram in the text and delete it.  Use
   'Insert Picture' to embed the new diagram in the document.
5) Save the revised word document.

If you are only modifing the text of the document, you
need only to do steps (3) and (5).
