# Script updates the copyright year in every file in Valgrind that contains
# a copyright notice.  Assumes they're all in the same format:
#
#     "Copyright (C) 20xy-2011"
#
# where x can be 0 or 1 and y can be anything.
# To use:
# - change the years in the 'perl' command below appropriately.
# - Run it from the base directory of a Valgrind workspace.  
# - And check the results look ok by diff'ing against the repository.
#
# Note that it will spit out some warnings when it runs;  ignore these.
#

# The find command deliberately skips .svn/ subdirs -- we don't want to
# change them.
