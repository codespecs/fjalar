# Script updates the copyright year in every file in Valgrind that contains
# a copyright notice.  Assumes they're all in the same format:
#
#     "Copyright (C) 200x-200y"
#
# To use:
# - change the years in the 'sed' command below appropriately.
# - Run it from the base directory of a Valgrind workspace.  
# - And check the results look ok by diff'ing against the repository.
#
# Note that it will spit out some warnings when it runs;  ignore these.
#
# Nb: after 2009, the sed string may have to be changed slightly -- it
# currently assumes the first year is in the range 2000..2009.

# The find command deliberately skips .svn/ subdirs -- we don't want to
# change them.
