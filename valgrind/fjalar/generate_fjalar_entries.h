// WARNING: The only entries in TypesTable are for types that are
// actually associated with variables used in the program.  If no
// variable in your program uses a certain type, then it does not have
// an entry in here!!!  This prevents us from including all sorts of
// junky types from libraries in this table (which have entries in the
// debug. info.) and ensures that we only have types in here that are
// referenced by variables that we are tracing.  The one down-side of
// this strategy is that when you are coercing types using a .disambig
// file, you must coerce it to a type that is used by some other
// variable, or else it doesn't appear in this table.

// Hash table containing TypeEntry entries
// Keys: the name of a TypeEntry (TypeEntry::typeName)
// Values: TypeEntry corresponding to that name
//         (Hopefully, if all goes well, the only TypeEntry values
//          in this table are REAL entries whose dwarf_entry has
//          is_declaration NULL, not fake declaration entries)

// Only non-basic types (IS_BASIC_TYPE(t) == 0) should appear in
// TypesTable:
