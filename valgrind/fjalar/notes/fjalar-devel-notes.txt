Fjalar development notes
by Philip Guo
------------------------

Fjalar currently doesn't do the right thing in MultipleStructsTest, a
perverse example where I have two completely different structs names
'alpha' and two completely different structs named 'beta', each hidden
from one another.  Fjalar has only one entry for each struct with a
given name, so it cannot disambiguate between the two different
'alphas' and 'betas'.
