Fjalar development notes
by Philip Guo
------------------------

Fjalar currently doesn't do the right thing in MultipleStructsTest, a
perverse example where I have two completely different structs names
'alpha' and two completely different structs named 'beta', each hidden
from one another.  Fjalar has only one entry for each struct with a
given name, so it cannot disambiguate between the two different
'alphas' and 'betas'.

TODO list:

We need Fjalar to be able to visit/print out C++ reference parameters
in a meaningful way.  The simplest way is to treat them simply as
pointers with an automatic 'P' disambiguation.  A more elegant way is
to not print out the address value of the reference (since that's
immutable and un-interesting) and to print out the value (without a
dereference symbol) as though it were a regular variable.

Print out better-looking OBJECT and CLASS program points with support
for superclass fields.

Perhaps add .disambig support for superclass variables.
