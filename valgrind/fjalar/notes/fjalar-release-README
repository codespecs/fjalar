Version 1.3 - Released August 30, 2007

Changed the visitation interface to use Addr instead of void *, and
pass separate values of locations to dereference and to print.  Avoid
using the system C library, since Valgrind doesn't play well with
it. Add AMD64 support. Fix memory leaks and various other bugs.

-----------

Version 1.2 - Released May 26, 2006

Re-factored the code to export a cleaner set of data structures in the
public API, as evident in fjalar_include.h, and made various minor bug
fixes.

-----------

Version 1.1 - Released Mar. 21, 2006

Ported over to an SVN head development version of Valgrind 3.2.0 in
Feb. 2006 and made some significant bug fixes to greatly improve C++
support and overall robustness.

-----------

Version 1.0 - Released Dec. 16, 2005

This is the first stand-alone release, so feedback is greatly
appreciated.  Please send emails to Philip Guo (pgbovine@mit.edu).
