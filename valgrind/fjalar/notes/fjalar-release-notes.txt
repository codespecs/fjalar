Notes for releasing Fjalar stand-alone as a package:

1.) Copy over the entire valgrind-3 directory and all sub-directories
into a folder and cd there.

2.) Remove all CVS/ directories - find . -type d -name 'CVS' blah blah

3.) Remove all temporary ~ files created by emacs

4.) Remove notes sub-directories, etc...

5.) ln -s valgrind-3/valgrind/fjalar/ fjalar-source to create a
convenient link from the top level

6.) Make a copy of the Fjalar home page and programmer's manual into
the directory

7.) Make a README file with the following contents:

8.) Remove other crappy temp files like .# files "find . -name '.#*' -exec echo rm {} \;"

9.) grep for kvasir, dyncomp, etc... to make sure we don't have any strays
