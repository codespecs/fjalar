Instructions for releasing Fjalar stand-alone as a package
by Philip Guo

These are now made somewhat obsolete by $INV/scripts/make-fjalar-release.sh

- Copy over the entire valgrind-3 directory and all sub-directories
into a folder and cd there.

- do a 'make clean' and 'make distclean'

- Remove all CVS/ directories: find . -type d -name CVS -exec rm -rf '{}' \;

- Remove all DynComp-specific things from Valgrind and VEX files, in
addition to Memcheck files:

(grep for ' PG' or 'pgbovine' to see which files I modified)

VEX/priv/host-generic/reg_alloc2.c
coregrind/m_scheduler/scheduler.c
coregrind/pub_core_threadstate.h
coregrind/m_machine.c (only remove DynComp-specific things like the tag stuff)
include/pub_tool_machine.h (only remove DynComp-specific things like the tag stuff)

- Cut out all dyncomp-related stuff from mc_main.c and mc_translate.c
(grep for 'PG', 'pgbovine', or 'dyncomp' - this may not be a trivial
task)

- Change mc_pre_clo_init() in mc_main.c to not print out the heading
that says Kvasir/DynComp but instead print out something
Fjalar-related.  And also change the contact info. and version number.

- Remove notes subdirectory and other misc. subdirectories within fjalar/

- Remove kvasir/ sub-directory within fjalar/, leaving only basic-tool

- Change fjalar/Makefile.am to build basic-tool instead of kvasir by
removing kvasir/ source files and adding 'basic-tool/basic-tool.c' to
FJALAR_SOURCES_COMMON

- ln -s valgrind-3/valgrind/fjalar/ fjalar-source to create a
convenient link from the top level to the Fjalar source code directory

- Replace the valgrind-3/valgrind/fjalar/README file with the
contents of fjalar-release-README from this directory.

- ln -s valgrind-3/valgrind/fjalar/README README to create a
convenient link from the top level to the Fjalar README file

- Remove all temporary ~ files created by emacs "find . -name '*~' -exec rm {} \;"

- Remove other crappy temp files like .# files "find . -name '.#*' -exec rm {} \;"

- grep again for kvasir, dyncomp, etc... to make sure we don't have
any strays

- rm -rf valgrind-3/valgrind/inst to not leave any binaries lying
around which take up dead space

- Go to valgrind-3/valgrind/fjalar/documentation/fjalar-www and clear
out old versions of Fjalar

- Put updated copies of fjalar_include.h and fjalar_tool.h on the main
Fjalar website, because those serve as the public interfaces

- Make a copy of the Fjalar home page and programmer's manual into the
valgrind-3/valgrind/fjalar/documentation directory.

- tar it up and put in on the web!
