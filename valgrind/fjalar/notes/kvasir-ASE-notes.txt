Try to run Lackwit on Flex:

PATH=/afs/csail.mit.edu/group/pag/software/pkg/gcc-2.95-links/bin/:$PATH strace -f -e execve dfec -w flex.c config.h flexdef.h parse.h version.h

lh - seems to add fake lh_return_value variables for Lackwit to find
comparability over return values

The slowness may likely come from our own querying of the
Lackwit-generated database

Concentrate Lackwit experiments on scalability rather than performance
