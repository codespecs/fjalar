/* Tree search for red/black trees.
   The algorithm for adding nodes is taken from one of the many "Algorithms"
   books by Robert Sedgewick, although the implementation differs.
   The algorithm for deleting nodes can probably be found in a book named
   "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen/Leiserson/Rivest.  At least that's
   the book that my professor took most algorithms from during the "Data
   Structures" course...

   Totally public domain.  */

/* Red/black trees are binary trees in which the edges are colored either red
   or black.  They have the following properties:
   1. The number of black edges on every path from the root to a leaf is
      constant.
   2. No two red edges are adjacent.
   Therefore there is an upper bound on the length of every path, it's
   O(log n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  No path can be longer
   than 1+2*P where P is the length of the shortest path in the tree.
   Useful for the implementation:
   3. If one of the children of a node is NULL, then the other one is red
      (if it exists).

   In the implementation, not the edges are colored, but the nodes.  The color
   interpreted as the color of the edge leading to this node.  The color is
   meaningless for the root node, but we color the root node black for
   convenience.  All added nodes are red initially.

   Adding to a red/black tree is rather easy.  The right place is searched
   with a usual binary tree search.  Additionally, whenever a node N is
   reached that has two red successors, the successors are colored black and
   the node itself colored red.  This moves red edges up the tree where they
   pose less of a problem once we get to really insert the new node.  Changing
   N's color to red may violate rule 2, however, so rotations may become
   necessary to restore the invariants.  Adding a new red leaf may violate
   the same rule, so afterwards an additional check is run and the tree
   possibly rotated.

   Deleting is hairy.  There are mainly two nodes involved: the node to be
   deleted (n1), and another node that is to be unchained from the tree (n2).
   If n1 has a successor (the node with a smallest key that is larger than
   n1), then the successor becomes n2 and its contents are copied into n1,
   otherwise n1 becomes n2.
   Unchaining a node may violate rule 1: if n2 is black, one subtree is
   missing one black edge afterwards.  The algorithm must try to move this
   error upwards towards the root, so that the subtree that does not have
   enough black edges becomes the whole tree.  Once that happens, the error
   has disappeared.  It may not be necessary to go all the way up, since it
   is possible that rotations and recoloring can fix the error before that.

   Although the deletion algorithm must walk upwards through the tree, we
   do not store parent pointers in the nodes.  Instead, delete allocates a
   small array of parent pointers and fills it while descending the tree.
   Since we know that the length of a path is O(log n), where n is the number
   of nodes, this is likely to use less memory.  */

/* Tree rotations look like this:
      A                C
     / \              / \
    B   C            A   G
   / \ / \  -->     / \
   D E F G         B   F
                  / \
                 D   E

   In this case, A has been rotated left.  This preserves the ordering of the
   binary tree.  */
