Here is a summary of the contents of the interesting source files:

Fjalar source files:

fjalar_tool.h - Contains prototypes for all functions that Fjalar
                tools must implement in order to compile properly

fjalar_include.h - This is the API that Fjalar provides to its tool.
                   Contains relevant data structures and functions.

fjalar_main.[ch] - Most of the code that interacts with the Valgrind
                   core.  Hooks into Valgrind to perform function
                   entrance and exit tracking, start-up and tear-down
                   code, command-line option processing.

typedata.[ch] - Hooks into the Readelf debugging info. parser to
                construct very low-level but organized data structures
                containing the information present in the DWARF2
                debug. info.  Essentially, Readelf was meant to only
                output text, but I hacked it to make calls into
                typedata.c so that it can populate the data structures
                defined in typedata.h.
