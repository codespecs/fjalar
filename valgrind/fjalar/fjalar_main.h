Requires:
Modifies: lowestSP of the top entry in FunctionExecutionStateStack
Returns:
Effects: Compares the current SP with the lowestSP from the current
         function and sets lowestSP to current SP if current SP
         is lower.  This will provide an indicator of how far down
         the function has ever reached on the stack.

This is called from hooks within mac_shared.h

  //Okay, this is called everytime somebody tries to allocate space
  //on the stack, but the function on the top of the stack is the
  //function that we are recording.  The problem is that if the
  //function that we are recording calls another function that
  //we do not record, that new function will mess around with the
  //stack all it wants, but those values aren't accurately reflected
  //by the lowestSP of the function we are currently recording.
  //For example, if my function "foo" drives the stack down to 100,000
  //and then it calls printf which calls other crap, driving the stack
  //down to 50,000, as far as foo is concerned, it only drove
  //the stack down to 100,000 but check_ESP() thinks it drove the
  //stack down to 50,000.

  //AD HOC solution: DON'T DEAL WITH THIS AT ALL!!!

/*
   It is not at all clear how we should number the FP stack registers
   for the x86 architecture.  If the version of SDB on x86/svr4 were
   a bit less brain dead with respect to floating-point then we would
   have a precedent to follow with respect to DWARF register numbers
   for x86 FP registers, but the SDB on x86/svr4 is so completely
   broken with respect to FP registers that it is hardly worth thinking
   of it as something to strive for compatibility with.
   The version of x86/svr4 SDB I have at the moment does (partially)
   seem to believe that DWARF register number 11 is associated with
   the x86 register %st(0), but that's about all.  Higher DWARF
   register numbers don't seem to be associated with anything in
   particular, and even for DWARF regno 11, SDB only seems to under-
   stand that it should say that a variable lives in %st(0) (when
   asked via an `=' command) if we said it was in DWARF regno 11,
   but SDB still prints garbage when asked for the value of the
   variable in question (via a `/' command).
   (Also note that the labels SDB prints for various FP stack regs
   when doing an `x' command are all wrong.)
   Note that these problems generally don't affect the native SVR4
   C compiler because it doesn't allow the use of -O with -g and
   because when it is *not* optimizing, it allocates a memory
   location for each floating-point variable, and the memory
   location is what gets described in the DWARF AT_location
   attribute for the variable in question.
   Regardless of the severe mental illness of the x86/svr4 SDB, we
   do something sensible here and we use the following DWARF
   register numbers.  Note that these are all stack-top-relative
   numbers.
	11 for %st(0) (gcc regno = 8)
	12 for %st(1) (gcc regno = 9)
	13 for %st(2) (gcc regno = 10)
	14 for %st(3) (gcc regno = 11)
	15 for %st(4) (gcc regno = 12)
	16 for %st(5) (gcc regno = 13)
	17 for %st(6) (gcc regno = 14)
	18 for %st(7) (gcc regno = 15)
