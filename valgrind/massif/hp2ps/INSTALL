NOTE: these are instructions for installing hp2ps separately.  If you only want
to use it with the Valgrind tool, Massif, it should be installed automatically.

The original Makefile, for which the below instructions apply, is kept as
Makefile.old.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For binary distribution: 

    - just copy "hp2ps" into an appropriate directory.

For source distribution: 

    - edit "Makefile" and set the $DSTBIN to the directory you wish to install
      hp2ps in

    - do "make install"
