# On Darwin, for a program 'p', the DWARF debug info is stored in the
# directory 'p.dSYM'.  This must be generated after the executable is
# created, with 'dsymutil p'.  We could redefine LINK with a script that
# executes 'dsymutil' after linking, but that's a pain.  Instead we use this
# hook so that every time "make check" is run, we subsequently invoke
# 'dsymutil' on all the executables that lack a .dSYM directory, or that are
# newer than their corresponding .dSYM directory.
