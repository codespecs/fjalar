//--------------------------------------------------------------------
// PURPOSE: This module deals with reading debug info and symbol tables
// to get file and function names, line numbers, variable types, and
// to help stack unwinding.
//--------------------------------------------------------------------

#include "pub_tool_debuginfo.h"

/* Initialise the entire module.  Must be called first of all. */

/* LINUX: Notify the debuginfo system about a new mapping, or the
   disappearance of such, or a permissions change on an existing
   mapping.  This is the way new debug information gets loaded.  If
   allow_SkFileV is True, it will try load debug info if the mapping
   at 'a' belongs to Valgrind; whereas normally (False) it will not do
   that.  This allows us to carefully control when the thing will read
   symbols from the Valgrind executable itself.

   If a call to VG_(di_notify_mmap) causes debug info to be read, then
   the returned ULong is an abstract handle which can later be used to
   refer to the debuginfo read as a result of this specific mapping,
   in later queries to m_debuginfo.  In this case the handle value
   will be one or above.  If the returned value is zero, no debug info
   was read.

   For VG_(di_notify_mmap), if use_fd is not -1, that is used instead
   of the filename; this avoids perturbing fcntl locks, which are
   released by simply re-opening and closing the same file (even via
   different fd!).
