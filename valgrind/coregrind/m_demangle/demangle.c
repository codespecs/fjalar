/* The demangler's job is to take a raw symbol name and turn it into
   something a Human Bean can understand.  There are two levels of
   mangling.

   1. First, C++ names are mangled by the compiler.  So we'll have to
      undo that.

   2. Optionally, in relatively rare cases, the resulting name is then
      itself encoded using Z-escaping (see pub_core_redir.h) so as to
      become part of a redirect-specification.

   Therefore, VG_(demangle) first tries to undo (2).  If successful,
   the soname part is discarded (humans don't want to see that).
   Then, it tries to undo (1) (using demangling code from GNU/FSF).

   Finally, change the name of all symbols which are known to be
   functions below main() to "(below main)".  This helps reduce
   variability of stack traces, something which has been a problem for
   the testsuite for a long time.

   --------
   If do_cxx_demangle == True, does all the above stages:
   - undo (2) [Z-encoding]
   - undo (1) [C++ mangling]
   - do the below-main hack

   If do_cxx_demangle == False, the middle stage is skipped:
   - undo (2) [Z-encoding]
   - do the below-main hack

/* Note that the C++ demangler is from GNU libiberty and is almost
   completely unmodified.  We use vg_libciface.h as a way to
   impedance-match the libiberty code into our own framework.

   The current code is from libiberty in the gcc tree, gcc svn
   r141363, dated 26 Oct 2008 (when the gcc trunk was in Stage 3
   leading up to a gcc-4.4 release).  As of r141363, libiberty is LGPL
   2.1, which AFAICT is compatible with "GPL 2 or later" and so is OK
   for inclusion in Valgrind.

   To update to a newer libiberty, it might be simplest to svn diff
   the gcc tree libibery against r141363 and then apply those diffs
   here. */

/* Demangle a Z-encoded name as described in pub_tool_redir.h. 
   Z-encoded names are used by Valgrind for doing function 
   interception/wrapping.

   Demangle 'sym' into its soname and fnname parts, putting them in
   the specified buffers.  Returns a Bool indicating whether the
   demangled failed or not.  A failure can occur because the prefix
   isn't recognised, the internal Z-escaping is wrong, or because one
   or the other (or both) of the output buffers becomes full.  Passing
   'so' as NULL is acceptable if the caller is only interested in the
   function name part. */
