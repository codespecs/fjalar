/* --------------------- CF INFO --------------------- */

/* DiCfSI: a structure to summarise DWARF2/3 CFA info for the code
   address range [base .. base+len-1].

   On x86 and amd64 ("IA"), if you know ({e,r}sp, {e,r}bp, {e,r}ip) at
   some point and {e,r}ip is in the range [base .. base+len-1], it
   tells you how to calculate ({e,r}sp, {e,r}bp) for the caller of the
   current frame and also ra, the return address of the current frame.

   First off, calculate CFA, the Canonical Frame Address, thusly:

     cfa = case cfa_how of
              CFIC_IA_SPREL -> {e,r}sp + cfa_off
              CFIC_IA_BPREL -> {e,r}bp + cfa_off
              CFIR_IA_EXPR  -> expr whose index is in cfa_off

   Once that is done, the previous frame's {e,r}sp/{e,r}bp values and
   this frame's {e,r}ra value can be calculated like this:

     old_{e,r}sp/{e,r}bp/ra
         = case {e,r}sp/{e,r}bp/ra_how of
              CFIR_UNKNOWN   -> we don't know, sorry
              CFIR_SAME      -> same as it was before (sp/fp only)
              CFIR_CFAREL    -> cfa + sp/bp/ra_off
              CFIR_MEMCFAREL -> *( cfa + sp/bp/ra_off )
              CFIR_EXPR      -> expr whose index is in sp/bp/ra_off

   On ARM it's pretty much the same, except we have more registers to
   keep track of:

     cfa = case cfa_how of
              CFIC_R13REL -> r13 + cfa_off
              CFIC_R12REL -> r12 + cfa_off
              CFIC_R11REL -> r11 + cfa_off
              CFIR_EXPR   -> expr whose index is in cfa_off

     old_r14/r13/r12/r11/ra
         = case r14/r13/r12/r11/ra_how of
              CFIR_UNKNOWN   -> we don't know, sorry
              CFIR_SAME      -> same as it was before (r14/r13/r12/r11 only)
              CFIR_CFAREL    -> cfa + r14/r13/r12/r11/ra_off
              CFIR_MEMCFAREL -> *( cfa + r14/r13/r12/r11/ra_off )
              CFIR_EXPR      -> expr whose index is in r14/r13/r12/r11/ra_off

      Comment_on_IMPORTANT_CFSI_REPRESENTATIONAL_INVARIANTS: we require that
 
      either (rx_map_size == 0 && cfsi == NULL) (the degenerate case)

      or the normal case, which is the AND of the following:
      (0) rx_map_size > 0
      (1) no two DebugInfos with rx_map_size > 0 
          have overlapping [rx_map_avma,+rx_map_size)
      (2) [cfsi_minavma,cfsi_maxavma] does not extend 
          beyond [rx_map_avma,+rx_map_size); that is, the former is a 
          subrange or equal to the latter.
      (3) all DiCfSI in the cfsi array all have ranges that fall within
          [rx_map_avma,+rx_map_size).
      (4) all DiCfSI in the cfsi array are non-overlapping

      The cumulative effect of these restrictions is to ensure that
      all the DiCfSI records in the entire system are non overlapping.
      Hence any address falls into either exactly one DiCfSI record,
      or none.  Hence it is safe to cache the results of searches for
      DiCfSI records.  This is the whole point of these restrictions.
      The caching of DiCfSI searches is done in VG_(use_CF_info).  The
      cache is flushed after any change to debugInfo_list.  DiCfSI
      searches are cached because they are central to stack unwinding
      on amd64-linux.

      Where are these invariants imposed and checked?

      They are checked after a successful read of debuginfo into
      a DebugInfo*, in check_CFSI_related_invariants.

      (1) is not really imposed anywhere.  We simply assume that the
      kernel will not map the text segments from two different objects
      into the same space.  Sounds reasonable.

      (2) follows from (4) and (3).  It is ensured by canonicaliseCFI.
      (3) is ensured by ML_(addDiCfSI).
      (4) is ensured by canonicaliseCFI.

      --------------------------------------------------------

      Comment_on_DEBUG_SVMA_and_DEBUG_BIAS_fields:

      The _debug_{svma,bias} fields were added as part of a fix to
      #185816.  The problem encompassed in that bug report was that it
      wasn't correct to use apply the bias values deduced for a
      primary object to its associated debuginfo object, because the
      debuginfo object (or the primary) could have been prelinked to a
      different SVMA.  Hence debuginfo and primary objects need to
      have their own biases.

      ------ JRS: (referring to r9329): ------
      Let me see if I understand the workings correctly.  Initially
      the _debug_ values are set to the same values as the "normal"
      ones, as there's a bunch of bits of code like this (in
      readelf.c)

         di->text_svma = svma;
         ...
         di->text_bias = rx_bias;
         di->text_debug_svma = svma;
         di->text_debug_bias = rx_bias;

      If a debuginfo object subsequently shows up then the
      _debug_svma/bias are set for the debuginfo object.  Result is
      that if there's no debuginfo object then the values are the same
      as the primary-object values, and if there is a debuginfo object
      then they will (or at least may) be different.

      Then when we need to actually bias something, we'll have to
      decide whether to use the primary bias or the debuginfo bias.
      And the strategy is to use the primary bias for ELF symbols but
      the debuginfo bias for anything pulled out of Dwarf.

      ------ THH: ------
      Correct - the debug_svma and bias values apply to any address
      read from the debug data regardless of where that debug data is
      stored and the other values are used for addresses from other
      places (primarily the symbol table).

      ------ JRS: ------ 
      Ok; so this was my only area of concern.  Are there any
      corner-case scenarios where this wouldn't be right?  It sounds
      like we're assuming the ELF symbols come from the primary object
      and, if there is a debug object, then all the Dwarf comes from
      there.  But what if (eg) both symbols and Dwarf come from the
      debug object?  Is that even possible or allowable?

      ------ THH: ------
      You may have a point...

      The current logic is to try and take any one set of data from
      either the base object or the debug object. There are four sets
      of data we consider:

         - Symbol Table
         - Stabs
         - DWARF1
         - DWARF2

      If we see the primary section for a given set in the base object
      then we ignore all sections relating to that set in the debug
      object.

      Now in principle if we saw a secondary section (like debug_line
      say) in the base object, but not the main section (debug_info in
      this case) then we would take debug_info from the debug object
      but would use the debug_line from the base object unless we saw
      a replacement copy in the debug object. That's probably unlikely
      however.

      A bigger issue might be, as you say, the symbol table as we will
      pick that up from the debug object if it isn't in the base. The
      dynamic symbol table will always have to be in the base object
      though so we will have to be careful when processing symbols to
      know which table we are reading in that case.

      What we probably need to do is tell read_elf_symtab which object
      the symbols it is being asked to read came from.

      (A followup patch to deal with this was committed in r9469).

      In short it's an

         array of (array of PC address ranges and variables)

      The outer array indexes over scopes, with Entry 0 containing
      information on variables which exist for any value of the program
      counter (PC) -- that is, the outermost scope.  Entries 1, 2, 3,
      etc contain information on increasinly deeply nested variables.

      Each inner array is an array of (an address range, and a set
      of variables that are in scope over that address range).  

      The address ranges may not overlap.
 
      Since Entry 0 in the outer array holds information on variables
      that exist for any value of the PC (that is, global vars), it
      follows that Entry 0's inner array can only have one address
      range pair, one that covers the entire address space.
