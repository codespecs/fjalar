   A struct to hold starting values for stack unwinding.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/* This really shouldn't be here.  But putting it elsewhere leads to a
   veritable swamp of new module cycles. */

/* To support CFA-based stack unwinding, and stack unwinding in
   general, we need to be able to get hold of the values of specific
   registers, in order to start the unwinding process.  This is
   unavoidably arch and platform dependent.  Here is a struct which
   holds the relevant values.  All platforms must have a program
   counter and a stack pointer register, but the other fields (frame
   pointer? link register? misc other regs?) are ad-hoc.  Note, the
   common fields are 64-bit, so as to make this host-independent. */
