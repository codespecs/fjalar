// PURPOSE: This module holds various bits of client state which don't
// live comfortably anywhere else.  Note that the ThreadStates for the
// client don't live here; they instead live in m_threadstate.h.  Most
// of these values are set once at startup and not changed later.

/* A fd which refers to the fake /proc/<pid>/cmdline in /tmp.  The
   idea is: make up the /proc/<pid>/cmdline file the client would
   expect to see if it was running natively.  Copy into a file in
   /tmp.  When the client then does an open of /proc/<pid>/cmdline or
   /proc/self/cmdline, instead give it a file handle to the file in
   /tmp.  The problem of deleting said file when Valgrind exits is
   neatly sidestepped by unlinking it as soon as it has been created,
   but holding on to the file handle.  That causes the kernel to keep
   the file contents alive exactly until the process exits. */
