/* A stubs for a return which we want to catch: a signal return.
   returns and pthread returns.  In the latter case, the thread's
   return value is in %EAX, so we pass this as the first argument
   to the request.  In both cases we use the user request mechanism.
   You need to to read the definition of VALGRIND_MAGIC_SEQUENCE
   in valgrind.h to make sense of this.

   This isn't used in-place.  It is copied into the client address space
   at an arbitary address.  Therefore, this code must be completely
