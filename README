This is the distribution of Fjalar, a dynamic analysis framework for C/C++ programs
Fjalar version 5.8.18, released June 23, 2023.

The majority of this source tree is a slightly modified version of Valgrind
(see file valgrind/REVISION for the upstream version of Valgrind).
Valgrind is a framework for building dynamic analysis tools.  You can learn
